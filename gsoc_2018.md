# My Summer@Elasticsearch

This summer I joined on the popular bandwagon, Google Summer of Code, with [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch). The remained of this post will try and summarise my work for the last 3-4 months.

### Overview
At its core Elasticsearch is a RESTful search and analytics engine. Requests are sent over a RESTful interface to a server and the response is delivered as a JSON. Elasticsearch offers [clients](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html) to perform these requests and get back responses in a variety of languages like Java, Javascript, Groovy, PHP, Python etc. My focus for this summer were the Java clients. Elasticsearch offers two kinds of Java clients. The [low-level-client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/java-rest-low.html) performs requests with raw JSON request bodies and responds back with raw JSON responses. This leaves the responsibility of forming the request JSON and parsing the response on the user. To ease the process a [high-level-client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/java-rest-high.html) was added. Essentially, this allows to form endpoint specific request objects and get the response back as a specific object from which relavent information can be accessed (as opposed to a generic JSON that would need parsing). The high-level-client is fairly new and, as of March, was still [incomplete](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/27205). My objective this summer was to add support for as many APIs as I could. I had a conservative aim of adding 6 APIs during the 12 week period of GSoC. With the support of my mentors I managed to do more than twice of what I had estimated by adding 11 APIs and still finding time to pitch in with a couple of other issues that interested me.

### Working of the Java clients
All clients work on top of the REST layer that is part of the server. A simplified version of the functioning of the REST layer is illustrated here.
